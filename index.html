            <h2>Different? Why?</h2>
            <p>
              Because it is not the incredible landscapes, or the wide variety of food that makes Colombia special. It's all about its people.

              Colombians put people first. Be ready to feel at home when you visit! Whether a free lunch, free night at some random person's house, or free smile, Colombians do not disappoint when it comes to kindness and generosity.

              Don't feel that people are creepers if they start talking to you out of nowhere, smile at you in the street without having a clue of who you are, or even if they want to pay your bill or invite you over to some Colombian parranda (party). Colombians are embracing!

              Although most Colombians suffer to live, they don't let anything stop their happiness. Colombia is constantly named among the happiest countries in the world.

              This year, <a href="https://www.lonelyplanet.com/colombia">Lonely Planet</a> has named Colombia the #2 best destination for 2017 just after Canada. There is nothing to worry about. The only risk is wanting to stay!

            <h2>Want to Fit In?</h2>
            <p>
              Just learn some basic phrases. In grandma's language style, <em>"thanks"</em> would be something like <em>"Mi Dios le pague y le de el cielo"</em> (May God pay you back and grant you entrance to heaven). Or something simpler like <em>"friend"</em>, technically you would say <em>"amigo"</em> but realistically, most people say "parce". Spanish is fun and Colombian Spanish, even more so!

            <h2>Nothing Missing</h2>
            <p>
              Colombia has it all or, as Colombians would say, <em>"Se le tiene"</em> (<em>"We have what you want"</em>). Your visit makes a great impact on the lives of Colombian people. As the tourism increases, aboriginals, artisans, business people, can improve the quality of their lives. Your trip has a higher impact than you would think.

              Visit the Amazon or La Guajira. You can interact with natives, see the pink dolphins, try to find caymans at night or have a great experience in the Caribbean ocean (in La Guajira). Colombians are all for adventure!

            <h2>Like Coffee?</h2>
            <p>
              It is all over the place. For a relaxing experience, visit the coffee triangle. As the tourism industry started to flourish after so many years of internal conflict, many coffee farms have handcrafted special experiences for foreign coffee lovers. If you're there, don't forget to try one of the most popular Colombian beverages: <em>"aguapanela"</em>. Many Colombians don't drink coffee with water but with aguapanela.

            <p>
              Colombia has come a long way. From the #1 country in terms of violent murders to a world example in terms of its capacity to reinvent itself after over 50 years of internal conflict. Colombia has a lot to offer.

              Medellin, the second largest city of the country, has been recognized as the most innovative city in the world. Its transportation system brings people together and it has served as a model for many countries around the world as well as for other cities within the country. Medellin is its people.

            Hello <span>Sapient team</span>! Thanks for visiting my microsite. I used this project to show a bit about the country where I come from because it has shaped me as a person and it has taught me that the most important thing in life is how you treat and how you relate to people which, as I see it, fits very well with the culture at SapientNitro.
          </p>

          <p>Below you will find my thought process and workflow for this project from beginning to completion.</p>

          <p>
            I probably would have taken a different approach should I have had more time (it was extended but I need the weekend for a school project). Basically, I would have created an interactive visualization of the different regions of Colombia and what can you do when you're there, as well as what are the characteristics of Colombians by region so that the user would be able to determine the particular region he/she would like to visit. Being more ambitious, I would have liked to create a database to store comments that people would be able to write on a map about a certain place in the country. These comments would be shown to users who want to visit that place (when they click on a trigger to show them).
          </p>

                <li>Received email with project at 9:02 PM</li>
                <li>Right away, switched into brainstorming mode</li>
                <li>Drew initial sketch. Hated it. Realized that I didn't have a clear idea</li>

              <ul>
                <li>Thought about a new approach: How can I incorporate the storyscaping concept in the project and somehow showcase something I love, while creating an engaging experience?</li>
                <li>Given the limited time and the fact that I had class and other assignments, I realized I wouldn't have time to produce new assets; therefore, I decided to keep it simple and use assets I already had.</li>
                <li>Searched for design inspiration</li>

                <li>Searched for assets that suit the content. Tried to incorporate video: didn't work.</li>
